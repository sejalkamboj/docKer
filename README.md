# YAML in Python

## Introduction
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization standard commonly used for configuration files and data storage. Python supports YAML using the `PyYAML` library, which allows easy reading and writing of YAML files.

## Features of YAML
- **Human-readable format**
- **Supports nested structures**
- **Easily editable**
- **Used in configuration files**
- **Supported across multiple programming languages**

## YAML Syntax
```yaml
students:
  - name: Alice
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.8
  - name: Bob
    age: 22
    major: Mathematics
    gpa: 3.5
```

# Python YAML Use Case

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
To handle YAML files in Python, install the `PyYAML` library:
```sh
pip install pyyaml
```

### Step 2: Create the YAML File
Create a `students.yaml` file containing student details:
```yaml
students:
  - name: Alice
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.8
  - name: Bob
    age: 22
    major: Mathematics
    gpa: 3.5
  - name: Charlie
    age: 20
    major: Physics
    gpa: 3.9
  - name: David
    age: 23
    major: Chemistry
    gpa: 3.2
  - name: Eva
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.7
```

### Step 3: Write the Python Application
Create an `app.py` file with the following script:
```python
import yaml

def load_data(file_path):
    """
    Load data from a YAML file.
    :param file_path: Path to the YAML file.
    :return: Data loaded from the YAML file.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    return data

def display_students(students):
    """
    Display information about all students.
    :param students: List of student dictionaries.
    """
    print("\nAll Students:")
    for student in students:
        print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}, Major: {student['major']}, GPA: {student['gpa']}")

def filter_students_by_gpa(students, min_gpa):
    """
    Filter and display students with a GPA above the specified minimum.
    :param students: List of student dictionaries.
    :param min_gpa: Minimum GPA for filtering.
    """
    filtered_students = [s for s in students if s['gpa'] >= min_gpa]
    print(f"\nStudents with GPA >= {min_gpa}:")
    if filtered_students:
        for student in filtered_students:
            print(f"Name: {student['name']}, Age: {student['age']}, Major: {student['major']}, GPA: {student['gpa']}")
    else:
        print("No students found.")

def main():
    data = load_data('students.yaml')
    students = data['students']
    display_students(students)
    min_gpa = float(input("\nEnter minimum GPA to filter students: "))
    filter_students_by_gpa(students, min_gpa)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
1. Ensure `app.py` and `students.yaml` are in the same directory.
2. Open the terminal and run:
```sh
python app.py
```

### Expected Output
```
All Students:
Name: Alice, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8
Name: Bob, Age: 22, Major: Mathematics, GPA: 3.5
Name: Charlie, Age: 20, Major: Physics, GPA: 3.9
Name: David, Age: 23, Major: Chemistry, GPA: 3.2
Name: Eva, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.7

Enter minimum GPA to filter students: 3.6

Students with GPA >= 3.6:
Name: Alice, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8
Name: Charlie, Age: 20, Major: Physics, GPA: 3.9
Name: Eva, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.7
```

### Conclusion
This Python application demonstrates how to read data from a YAML file, process it, and display the results. You can extend this by adding features such as sorting, updating student information, or writing back to the YAML file.
